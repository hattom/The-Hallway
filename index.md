## Welcome to HPC Hallway

A place for **informal discussions** around HPC, AI, Cloud, and related topics.
We strongly encourage and gladly welcome new people to participate, from any background, recognizing that diversity and inclusivity makes our community better.

The HPC Hallway resulted from the weekly #HPCHuddles started by Andrew Jones [@hpcnotes](https://twitter.com/hpcnotes) on Twitter in March 2020.

## HPC Huddle

The HPC huddle is an open, informal weekly online videocall of people - join us using [**this link (https://aka.ms/hpc_hallway)**](https://aka.ms/hpc_hallway).
Come and join the conversation - live during the #HPCHuddles or find link collections through our slack channel.
The **huddle** has some simple **rules**: (1) be kind to each other, and (2) give everybody a chance to speak.

We now have agreed on a schedule the huddle follows.
To make participation possible to as many people as possible, it does change the day of the week and the time of the day.
